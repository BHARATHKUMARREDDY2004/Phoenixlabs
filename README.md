## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BHARATHKUMARREDDY2004/Phoenixlabs
   cd phoenixlabs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Expo development server:**
   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Run on your device:**
   - Use the Expo Go app (iOS/Android) to scan the QR code
   - Or run on an emulator/simulator

---

## Environment & Configuration
- All configuration is managed via `app.json` and `.env` (if needed)
- API endpoints are set in `api/` and can be updated as required
- Splash screen and icons are configured in `app.json` (see [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/app-icons/))

---

## Architectural Decisions
- **Expo + React Native**: Fast prototyping, cross-platform support
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the codebase
- **Zustand**: Lightweight, scalable state management
- **Zod**: Schema validation for forms and API data
- **NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)**: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- **Custom Alert System**: Unified, themeable alerts across the app
- **File-based Routing**: Organized navigation using Expo Router
